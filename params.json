{"name":"xdp2xsd","tagline":"Convert Adobe LiveCycle xdp forms to xsd schemas","body":"###Solving the problem of creating schemas for your LiveCycle business forms\r\n\r\n\"xdp to xsd\" is a node.js command line utility that converts a LiveCycle form (xdp) to an xml schema (xsd).\r\n\r\n####Usage\r\n`$ node xdp2xsd business_form.xdp > business_form.xsd` \r\n\r\nCurrent limitations (see Issues...)\r\n* Every field transforms into xsd:String\r\n* No support for fragments that have local overrides\r\n* No master page fields yet\r\n* No support for explicit bindings (ref=\"...\")\r\n\r\nThe xsd is generated inline, i.e. no types/references. I find this more readable.\r\n\r\nThere's also a `STRICT_BINDING [false]` option (in the top of xdp.js). The default `false` setting results in a forgiving schema, i.e. every node in optional meaning that the xml may omit fields. This is probably what you want: Say you have a LiveCycle process that accepts xml data, which will eventually be merged with an xdp business form. As a consumer of that service, you probably expect being able to skip certain fields (or entire subforms for that matter) and settle for data binding of the sloppier kind.\r\n\r\nYou can always edit the schema afterwords and point out which fields are mandatory.\r\n\r\nA general note on forms using fragments: make sure you apply unambiguous naming to fragments, or you will have a form repository maintenance nightmare once you start adding, removing or reordering fragments in the fragment file. (If you keep it to one fragment per fragment file, this shouldn't be an issue.) xdp2xsd does support fragment \"array\" references like 'form.customer_fragment[3]', but I strongly encourage you to avoid this naming convention.\r\n\r\nxdp2xsd uses log4js, hence you should find a xdp2xsd.log in the root directory. A tip is to:\r\n\r\n`$ tail -f xdp2xsd.log'\r\n\r\nin a separate term during the conversion.\r\n\r\n#### To-do\r\n\r\nOther than the issue section:\r\n\r\n* Clean up\r\n* Write tests\r\n\r\n> Written by [Christian Lagerkvist](https://github.com/o-o-).\r\n\r\n#### License\r\nMIT","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
